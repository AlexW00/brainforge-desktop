Brainforge is a prototypical Obsidian clone.

It offers:

- _basic_ **Markdown** support and File Browsing
- an integrated **browser** (e.g. -> [lobsters](https://lobste.rs/))
- **workspace** management

## Installation

- Download Brainforge from the [releases](https://github.com/AlexW00/brainforge-desktop/releases)

## Usage

- pretty much documented in the video
- to toggle md preview: cmd + e

## Notes

1. This is a protoype I built in ~1 week. Feel free to do whatever you want with it!
2. It's only tested on Linux.
3. I won't work on this project anymore (maybe I'll start in a year or so again); Until then, I'm busy [learning Japanese (- as a software engineer)](https://alexanderweichart.de/4_Projects/how-i-learn-jp/How-I-learn-Japanese-(as-a-Software-Engineer)))!
