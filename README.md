# Brainforge

Brainforge is a prototypical Obsidian clone.

It offers:

- _basic_ **Markdown** support and File Browsing
- an integrated **browser** (e.g. -> [lobsters](https://lobste.rs/))
- **workspace** management

Note: This is a protoype I built in ~1 week. Feel free to do whatever you want with it!
