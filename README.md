Brainforge is a prototypical Obsidian clone.

It offers:

- _basic_ **Markdown** support and File Browsing
- an integrated **browser** (e.g. -> [lobsters](https://lobste.rs/))
- **workspace** management

## Installation

- Download Brainforge from the [releases](https://github.com/AlexW00/brainforge-desktop/releases)

## Usage

- pretty much documented in the video
- to toggle md preview: cmd + e

## Notes

1. This is a protoype I built in ~1 week. Feel free to do whatever you want with it!
2. The idea was to build an integrated learning environment that supports flashcards, [Yomitan](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan)-Like popovers and AI chat (I only got so far...)
3. It's only tested on Linux.
4. I won't work on this project anymore (maybe I'll start in a year or so again); Until then, I'm busy [learning Japanese (- as a software engineer)](https://alexanderweichart.de/4_Projects/how-i-learn-jp/How-I-learn-Japanese-(as-a-Software-Engineer))!
